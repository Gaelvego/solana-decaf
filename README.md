## What is SnapPay?

SnaPay is a crypto app that simplifies transactions using a prompt-based system and intuitive UI. Send, receive, and split bills effortlessly without prior crypto knowledge. Seamlessly integrate blockchain into your daily life.

## What problem does SnapPay solve?

SnapPay solves the problem of complexity and lack of accessibility in cryptocurrency transaction, caused mainly by the lack of understanding about blockchain technologies, which in consequence reduces the number of potential users. SnapPay eliminates the need for users to possess prior knowledge or experience in blockchain technology, thanks to its intuitive UI and prompt-based system. SnapPay makes it easy for anyone to send, receive, and split bills using cryptocurrencies, by simplifying the process allowing users to seamlessly integrate blockchain into their daily life

## What's next for SnapPay?

Expanding on our vision of facilitating the usage of crypto, we want to implement the ability to convert your cryptocurrency to cash. We also plan on adding more transaction methods so that users have multiple options when paying; this would include the ability to buy cryptocurrency directly on SnapPay using other payment methods.
